Stack with more than one type
We always push to st (whether from left to right or right to left)
There is a popping instance which is the same instance were we perform our operation and apend the result to st.
While looping, you try to make the stack as readable as possible (we maintain cleanliness of our stack). For example, in 394, we append digit numbers to be one item in stack.

In 150, op (like "-", "+", etc)
In dev, rightmost op (like "-", "+", etc )
In 439, rightmost "?" followed by flag ("T" or "F")
In 394, closing bracket
In 726, closing bracket
