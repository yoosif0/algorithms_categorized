# Greedy

# Constructive
I find that sorting is needed for all problems here
## Knapsack
Optimal way to pack a knapsack with items of different weights and values

### Fractional
I noticed that in each of the problems here,

1. we need to have array sorted starting by the most ideal element to the least ideal, whether this is value, value per weight, required units to fullfill, or whatever
2. there is a condition where we break from the loop
