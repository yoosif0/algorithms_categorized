# Rotated sorted arr
Whenever the mid array has a value larger than end of array you know the pivot point (lowest val) is
between m and r



# Consumption
```python
def fn(a: list[int], k:int)

```

Input is always an array A and number k, where we would consume items in A by k.

Examples
* candies eaten by people
* bananas eaten within hours
* packages shipped within days
* products distributed to stores

The output can be 
* max items in A consumed by one unit of k => 875, 1011, 2226, 2064
* 


# No arr
No data structure to perform binary search on. There is only min (l) and max (r)
