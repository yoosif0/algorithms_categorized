```python
def fn(a: list[int], k:int)

```

Input is always an array A and number k, where we would consume items in A by k.

Examples
* candies eaten by people
* bananas eaten within hours
* packages shipped within days
* products distributed to stores

The output can be 
* max items in A consumed by one unit of k => 875, 1011, 2226, 2064
*
